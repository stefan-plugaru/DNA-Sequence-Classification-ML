# DNA Sequence Classification with Machine Learning
BSc Computer Science final-year project on classifying DNA sequences using traditional machine learning models in Python

## Main Ideas
- Parsing and preprocessing DNA base-pair sequences from raw transcript data
- Feature engineering from sequence data
- Models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Naive Bayes
- Comparison of model performance using train/test splits and standard metrics

## Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
